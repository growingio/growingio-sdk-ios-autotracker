@class GrowingFMDatabase;

/** To perform queries and updates on multiple threads, you'll want to use `GrowingFMDatabaseQueue`.

 Using a single instance of `<FMG3Database>` from multiple threads at once is a bad idea.  It has always been OK to make a `<FMG3Database>` object *per thread*.  Just don't share a single instance across threads, and definitely not across multiple threads at the same time.

 Instead, use `GrowingFMDatabaseQueue`. Here's how to use it:

 First, make your queue.

    GrowingFMDatabaseQueue *queue = [GrowingFMDatabaseQueue databaseQueueWithPath:aPath];

 Then use it like so:

    [queue inDatabase:^(FMG3Database *db) {
        [db executeUpdate:@"INSERT INTO myTable VALUES (?)", [NSNumber numberWithInt:1]];
        [db executeUpdate:@"INSERT INTO myTable VALUES (?)", [NSNumber numberWithInt:2]];
        [db executeUpdate:@"INSERT INTO myTable VALUES (?)", [NSNumber numberWithInt:3]];

        GrowingFMResultSet *rs = [db executeQuery:@"select * from foo"];
        while ([rs next]) {
            //…
        }
    }];

 An easy way to wrap things up in a transaction can be done like this:

    [queue inTransaction:^(FMG3Database *db, BOOL *rollback) {
        [db executeUpdate:@"INSERT INTO myTable VALUES (?)", [NSNumber numberWithInt:1]];
        [db executeUpdate:@"INSERT INTO myTable VALUES (?)", [NSNumber numberWithInt:2]];
        [db executeUpdate:@"INSERT INTO myTable VALUES (?)", [NSNumber numberWithInt:3]];

        if (whoopsSomethingWrongHappened) {
            *rollback = YES;
            return;
        }
        // etc…
        [db executeUpdate:@"INSERT INTO myTable VALUES (?)", [NSNumber numberWithInt:4]];
    }];

 `GrowingFMDatabaseQueue` will run the blocks on a serialized queue (hence the name of the class).  So if you call `GrowingFMDatabaseQueue`'s methods from multiple threads at the same time, they will be executed in the order they are received.  This way queries and updates won't step on each other's toes, and every one is happy.

 @warning Do not instantiate a single `<FMG3Database>` object and use it across multiple threads. Use `GrowingFMDatabaseQueue` instead.
 
 @warning The calls to `GrowingFMDatabaseQueue`'s methods are blocking.  So even though you are passing along blocks, they will **not** be run on another thread.
